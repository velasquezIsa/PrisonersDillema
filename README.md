My name is Isabela Velasquez and here is where I'll keep the evolution of my project. 
\
Based on the Prisoner's Dillema through agents simulations in C, I am focused in understading the conditions which will lead to cooperation endurance. At first, I am building simulations that represent system without movement, such as total density of the network or just stopped agents. These nets are all non-deterministic, so they do not have the same density (agent per space) neither the same distribuition of strategies (C or D). 
Further on, movement will be added and the cooperation will be tested when fewer cooperators are placed on the net.
\
For now, below there is the description of the codes I uploaded.
\
\
L100_M0_RHO1_S42.c : this is the code I began with. It has a net with full density and time(NULL) as the seed. It was stablished a net with 10.000 spaces, all of them with agents which have their strategy decided with a 50% chance of being a cooperator (C) or a non cooperator (D). It can also make a image of the net in colors, with C as blue and D as red, at the beggining and at the end of the simulation, as well as print the density of cooperators in this same instants.
\
L100_M0_RHO(0-1).c : 
\
repeat.sh : It's a code in bash that I use to repeat a code a "reps" number of times. It needs the name of the code and the folder which the outputs will go.
