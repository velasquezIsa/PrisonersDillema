My name is Isabela Velasquez and here is where I'll keep the evolution of my project. 
\
Based on the Prisoner's Dillema through agents simulations in C, I am focused in understading the conditions which will lead to cooperation endurance. At first, I am building simulations that represent system without movement, such as total density of the network or just stopped agents. These networks are all non-deterministic, so they do not have the same density (agent/space) neither the same distribuition of strategies (C or D). Further on, movement will be added and the cooperation will be tested when fewer cooperators are placed on the network.
\
More details will be added as I make progress.
